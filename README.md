### To download the project, clone: 

### Then apply an npm install to both folders, And to be able to run the application locally, the frontend command is:

``` npm run dev ```

And the backend is:
 
``` npm start ```

### And due to impediments to protect my machine, permissions and setbacks that affected my progress, I was unable to perform the Deploy, but I CAN SHOW the Application live
